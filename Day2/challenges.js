### Day 2 JavaScript Challenges

#### Exercise 1: Variables and Constants
1. Declare a variable to store your age and print it to the console.
2. Declare a constant to store the value of pi (3.14159) and print it to the console.

#### Exercise 2: Assigning Values
3. Declare two variables, `x` and `y`, and assign them values of 5 and 10 respectively. Print their values to the console.

#### Exercise 3: Swapping Values
4. Write a program that swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable. For example, if `a = 1` and `b = 2`, after swapping, `a` should be 2 and `b` should be 1.

#### Exercise 4: Simple Arithmetic
5. Declare three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Assign them values of 3, 7, and 2 respectively. Perform the following operations and print the results:
   - Addition of `a` and `b`
   - Subtraction of `b` and `c`
   - Multiplication of `a` and `c`
   - Division of `b` by `a`
   - Remainder of `b` divided by `c`

#### Exercise 5: Increment and Decrement
6. Declare a variable `num` with an initial value of 10. Increment the variable by 1 and print the result. Then decrement the variable by 1 and print the result.

#### Exercise 6: Compound Assignment
7. Declare a variable `total` with an initial value of 50. Use compound assignment operators to:
   - Add 20 to `total`
   - Subtract 10 from `total`
   - Multiply `total` by 2
   - Divide `total` by 5
   - Print the result after each operation

Good luck with your exercises! Once you're ready, we can review the solutions together.
