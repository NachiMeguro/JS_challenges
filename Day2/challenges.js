// Day 2 JavaScript Challenges

// Exercise 1: Variables and Constants
// 1. Declare a variable to store your age and print it to the console.

let my_age = 27;

console.log(my_age);

//2. Declare a constant to store the value of pi (3.14159) and print it to the console.

const pi = 3.14159;
console.log(pi);

/* #### Exercise 2: Assigning Values
3. Declare two variables, `x` and `y`, and assign them values of 5 and 10 respectively. Print their values to the console.*/

let x = 5;
let y = 10;

console.log("x: ", x ,"y: ", y);

/*#### Exercise 3: Swapping Values
4. Write a program that swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable. For example, if `a = 1` and `b = 2`, after swapping, `a` should be 2 and `b` should be 1.*/

let a = 1;
let b = 2;

console.log("Initially a is: ", a);
console.log("Initially b is: ", b);

[a, b] = [b, a];

console.log("After swapping, a is: ", a);
console.log("After swapping, a is: ", b);

/*#### Exercise 4: Simple Arithmetic
5. Declare three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Assign them values of 3, 7, and 2 respectively. Perform the following operations and print the results:
   - Addition of `a` and `b`
   - Subtraction of `b` and `c`
   - Multiplication of `a` and `c`
   - Division of `b` by `a`
   - Remainder of `b` divided by `c`

#### Exercise 5: Increment and Decrement
6. Declare a variable `num` with an initial value of 10. Increment the variable by 1 and print the result. Then decrement the variable by 1 and print the result.

#### Exercise 6: Compound Assignment
7. Declare a variable `total` with an initial value of 50. Use compound assignment operators to:
   - Add 20 to `total`
   - Subtract 10 from `total`
   - Multiply `total` by 2
   - Divide `total` by 5
   - Print the result after each operation

Good luck with your exercises! Once you're ready, we can review the solutions together.
